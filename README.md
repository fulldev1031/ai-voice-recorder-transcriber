# ai-voice-recorder-transcriber
This project is an interactive desktop application that allows users to record audio in real-time, save the recordings, and transcribe the audio to text using the Whisper AI model. The user-friendly interface is built with Tkinter, making it easy to start and stop recordings and generate transcriptions with just a few clicks.
