This project is an interactive desktop application that allows users to record audio in real-time, save the recordings, and transcribe the audio to text using the Whisper AI model. The user-friendly interface is built with Tkinter, making it easy to start and stop recordings and generate transcriptions with just a few clicks.

This Python-based GUI application allows you to record audio, save it as a `.wav` file, and transcribe it into text using OpenAI's Whisper model. Built with `tkinter`, it features buttons to start/stop recording and transcribe audio, saving the recording as `output.wav` and the transcription as `transcription.txt`.

## üî• Features
1. *Real-Time Audio Recording:*
Users can start and stop audio recordings with the click of a button. Audio is captured using PyAudio, ensuring high-quality recordings.

2. *Audio File Management:*
Recorded audio is saved in WAV format for compatibility and quality retention. Automatic file saving upon stopping the recording. 

3. *AI-Powered Transcription:*
Uses Whisper, an advanced speech-to-text model, to transcribe recorded audio. Transcription results are saved to a text file for easy access and further use.

4. *User-Friendly Interface:*
Built with Tkinter, the application provides a simple, clean, and responsive interface. Buttons are styled for ease of use and accessibility.
## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Fork this repository:** Fork the `fulldev1031/ai-voice-recorder-transcriber` repository. Follow these instructions on [how to fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

2. **Clone the project:** `git clone git@github.com:your-username/ai-voice-recorder-transcriber`

3. **Required downloads:**
```bash
  cd ai-voice-recorder-transcriber
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Alternative ways to download the dependencies:**
- To run, install Python 3.8+ and required packages (`pyaudio` and `whisper`) using
```bash
pip install pyaudio whisper
```

- Whisper downloads its models on the first run; ensure an active internet connection. Customize the Whisper model by modifying `whisper.load_model("small")` in the code (options: tiny, base, small, medium, large).

## üöÄ How It Works
* Start Recording: Click the "Start Recording" button to begin capturing audio. The button will be disabled while recording is in progress. 
* Stop Recording: Click the "Stop Recording" button to end the audio capture. The application saves the audio to a file and enables the transcription feature.
* Transcribe Audio: Click the "Transcribe" button to convert the recorded audio into text. The transcribed text is saved to a file named transcription.txt.
